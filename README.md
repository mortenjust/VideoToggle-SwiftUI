#  Live-streaming toggle

I showed [Pratik's nightmode toggle](https://github.com/pratikg29/LightDarkMode-ToggleStyle) to [a few friends on Twitter](https://twitter.com/mortenjust/status/1609982359515938818) and some of them were very concerned that the weather in the toggle might be different from the weather outside. So I added live video streaming from two places on earth. It only works around 9pm CET.
